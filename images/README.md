These files are only in here as a copy, they are not part of the extension and have nothing to do with it.
They are not referenced, as they don't belong to me. I don't know the rights to them or if Jamie would be upset if I used them,
so I have chosen not o include them as the icon, but have left the  content here in case anyone needs these images.
